# BlockBite Landing Page

Welcome to the official repository for the landing page of our decentralized food delivery application powered by blockchain!

## 🌍 Project Overview

In a world where transparency and security in transactions matter more than ever, we've designed a food delivery application that leverages the power of blockchain. Our decentralized approach ensures end-to-end transparency, trustworthiness, and ensures that both restaurants and customers get the utmost value.
